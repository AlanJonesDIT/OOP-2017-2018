## Lab

### Learning Outcomes
- Enroll on Webcourses
- Become familiar with the syntax of Processing
- Become familiar with writing and running sketches in Processing

Log onto Webcourses and enroll on the module CMPU2016.

Look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* noStroke
* noFill
* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size
* arc
* triangle

Write a processing sketch to draw the following shapes:

![Sketch](images/p1.png)

![Sketch](images/p1.1.png)

![Sketch](images/p1.2.png)

I prefer to draw the shapes on paper first before I try and work out the coordinates. Try experimenting with different colours
